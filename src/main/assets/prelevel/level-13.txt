I’m very glad that you didn’t disappoint me, Master Sgt. I always knew that you were able to navigate complex situations and to pull the trigger only when the enemy stopped jerking.

I have good and bad news.

Good news - we were able to decipher a few more documents. Bad news - you’re in the New Order’s Right Hand’s lab, and not on the main base of the gunmen. So you have to clean up these stables from any organic waste. On basis of captured documents, we can say that the next half an hour you won’t meet serious resistance. Well, 28 heavy exoscaphs aren’t a problem, are they?

Hmm, I hear you stop breathing, Master Sgt. I was joking, there won’t be any heavy exoscaphs, relax.
