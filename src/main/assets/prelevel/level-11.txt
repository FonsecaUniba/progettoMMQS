Luck is again on these enemies of the Empire’s working men’s side, they got away from us again. But this can’t last endlessly. The last place where Left Hand of New Order can hide is an old plant; the coordinates were posted to you. Scan from satellites shows that in the mountains that surround the plant there’re no passes, and our interceptors are already approaching. Also, we haven’t traced any aircraft start in the area. So go and get him, Master Sgt. I won’t be offended if Left Hand appears before our interrogators not very hunky.

Now the bad news: our bad guy is not so simple; captured at the entrance to the complex security guards say that Left Hand never parts with a bulletproof vest and is very fond of “power fists”. So when you find our friend, just stun him from a distance. A couple dozen of charges in a bulletproof vest may do it well.
