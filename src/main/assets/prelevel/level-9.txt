shshshsh ... pshshshshsh .... .. hear you. I confirm receipt of information about the next part of the object L2. Just a couple of minutes ago we received information that in the lab there’s someone called The Left Hand of the New Order. Our analysts suggest that this is one of the main conspiracy leaders. So, if you follow our plan F-117, then you need to find that Left Hand as quickly as possible.

We can’t help with information on the next area. Our satellites can’t scan the next level of the lab, because it is located far enough under the mountain range. So, be careful.
