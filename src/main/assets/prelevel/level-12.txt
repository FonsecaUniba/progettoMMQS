Congratulations on a brilliantly done job, Master Sergeant! Our cryptanalysts are already working on deciphering of the documents that were able to capture. What we found out is disappointing.

The scope of action of the New Order was much more than we expected. Such a huge, well conspiratorial organization, we haven’t seen for a long time. We work too bad if we could miss it. On the basis of documents, which had been already studied, we can say that there’re at least two labs of this kind. One of those labs’ coordinates had been received just a few minutes ago, they had already been sent to your PDA.

There won’t be any details more, we have to throw you into the jaws of aqualong, we have no choice.
