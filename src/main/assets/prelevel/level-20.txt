D’you assert that you meet with strong resistance, sergeant-major? So you're approaching to your goal.

I’ll tell you something what have happened after your last report. As it turned out, the Senate and Information Office were attacked as well as IBF General Office. Attempt of capturing the Senate failed, we repulsed, though with the losses among the civilians. But we have some more troubles with Information Office. The attackers took hostages from the staff and locked themselves in a central data center, but they don’t set any claims so far.

And the captured traitors tell such interesting things! What do you think who is behind the scene? That's right, Renaissance and New Order. Veeeeeeeery interesting things we learn recently.
