Still, I was right, sergeant-major, and not everything is like clockwork in our organization. Literally 40 minutes ago, a group of unknown people attempted to take control of IBF General Office building by the armed seizure, and the attack was delivered from two sides: at least 60 well-armed and equipped men to the main entrance plus the traitors inside the building tried to capture and retain the arsenal, IBF Head’s Office, and the barracks. But they're out of luck. Assailants were let down by the passion for theatrical effects and lack of coordination. It's too suspicious, when black trucks drive up to IBF General Office building from several different directions at once, and men in black uniform, unknown to us, jump out and begin to move directly to us. Positions outside managed to warn the officer on duty, and she managed to alarm the regiment and transmit the alarm signal further. Now imagine the picture: crowd of not our best men burst in the office of the regimental commander, Colonel Deadcorpser, demanding to surrender, or they will hurt him. And he had already got and charged his staunch “Mauzer” from the safe, it was good that common alarm had already been raised. And he shot them almost all right in his office.

Due to the incoherence of the assailants’ attack, the regiment was able to resist, and the attack got bogged down, the enemy retreated. Not all the traitors managed to leave the building, and then they barricaded themselves in the West Wing and maintain fierce resistance, they haven’t any choice. That’s how the cookie crumbles.

I can’t give you any new orders yet, I think, you should continue to move in the direction of the lab, and don’t display too much heroism there.
