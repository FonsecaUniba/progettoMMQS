The search of stolen container with ektanium is cancelled. For once, our measures have been effective and we were able to intercept the transport with container. So fans of the New Order won’t have a chance to be off our mortal planet for a long time, and they’ll have to survive the apocalypse in 2112 with us, mwahahaha. For example, I’m going to sleep well during the day A.

But the interception of stolen ektanium is just one small part of what is still to be done. Prince Paul is not found yet, and Information Department is still in the hands of fanatics. So there is no time to relax and drink champagne. Keep searching.
