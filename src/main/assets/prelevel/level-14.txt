Master sergeant, after the job you may come to me for your share. D’you ask what share it is? We’ve got into an argument with the Head of D Department, that you contact us with the report of successfully done job within half an hour. He didn’t believe in us, and it’s bad. I’ll have to tell his supervisor to keep an eye on his charge.

Now let’s move on to not so good news. Just a moment ago there was an emergency message from the Nucleus, that all agents who are on the job must pay great attention to the males from 12 to 14 in the places of operation; photos are attached. Upon detection of such persons you should immediately ensure their safety and security and request immediate evacuation plan LSD. And stop this silly giggling, “Magical Unicorn” doesn’t fly out for anyone.

There is no any additional information so far.
