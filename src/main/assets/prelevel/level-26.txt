That’s all, Sergeant-Major, all satellite scans and captured lab plans show that the only place where Head of the New Order still can hide is the 7th sector of the lab, which is located right outside the door before you.

The psychological portrait of the fanatics’ head, created by our psychologists, shows us that the required person doesn’t like large open spaces and lots of people around him. Though he’s crazy, he’s not stupid, so most likely you’ll meet the best fighters of the New Order. Fanatics break the law of the human body modification, and reinforce themselves with all kinds of implants and use illegal stimpacks. I think, you remember what the results of the experiments with similar things in 2078 were and how long we were trying to recover from the events of those days.

There were no such events in the Empire for a long time as accidents in the past three days. We’ve become too relaxed, mired in doing nothing. That’s why we got what we deserved. It’s vital to us to capture the Head of the New Order, it’s better alive, of course, but dead isn’t so bad too. Do it, master sergeant, and the Empire will never forget you.
