Ease, Master Sgt. Some individuals at the top feel uncomfortable ‘cause of our recent job results. Duh, such a conspiracy was missed. During an emergency meeting of the Committee departments’ heads I was told so much that even a bust of Harry Trueman blushed. There was so much dissatisfaction with the fact that you hadn’t left almost anyone in the lab, who could answer a few questions “what’s going on?” and “what are all these robots?”

Soon some heads and stars may go to hell in a handbasket, and we’ll be left holding the baby. So, like it or not, but we’ll have to continue swimming in all this swamp. Thank Chaos, but we managed to introduce a few agents in the Renaissance Corporation. On the basis of his reports, our analysts found out where there might be lab of the type you’d smashed up. We have to verify our suspicions.

It’s time to put a fight up! Instructions will be given to you in 15 minutes in room number 42.
