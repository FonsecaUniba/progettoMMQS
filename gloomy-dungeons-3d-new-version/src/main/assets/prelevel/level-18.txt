According to the data and your coordinates, you are just a few kilometers from the main lab of the New Order. We calculated that your transport should enter the territory of the lab with the least protected side, but as we see, we were wrong again, and it wasn’t the most unprotected side. But the enemies think they have given short shrift to your group, so you have complete freedom of action, but don’t make too much noise. No need to warn the enemy before the time of your presence.

Your present job is simple: try to get to the last lab. By the way, d’you know how this lab is called in Renaissance? No less than “The First Ark”! It seems that someone has very well-fed running rats in the attic.
