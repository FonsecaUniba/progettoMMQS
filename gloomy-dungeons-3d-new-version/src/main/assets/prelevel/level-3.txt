Master Sergeant, I congratulate you with the first report. On behalf of the command I thank you officially. Report the situation.

Hmm, you say, you’ve found an interesting sector in the basement, where the guards opened fire without warning? Hope, they didn’t spoil your uniform? You say these ungrateful bastards splattered your boots with their filthy blood? How dare they!

...

Well, it’s much more interesting. Door with a serious combination lock? But it was greedy of them to save on the hinges. You could break it down quietly, but OK. By the way, our analysts suggest me that if you continue to move in the same direction, in a mile you’ll be in the place where we got the last signal from the agent DX486. Try to get closer, but do not risk so much.
