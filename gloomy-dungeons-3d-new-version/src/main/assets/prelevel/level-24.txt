Bad news: 24 minutes ago one of the plants producing ektanium was attacked, there’re victims, and in spite of the guard’s unprecedented measures there’re enormous losses of the attackers, the fanatics were able to capture a container with ektanium. The scope of operation for the plant capture strikes, the enemy used 2 tanks and 3 shock bots. So the attack on our Main Office is not up to much, the worst is still to come. Empire is almost officially declared war.

I have to be at an emergency meeting in 15 minutes, so listen to the combat mission: to continue searching of Head of the New Order in the lab, and upon detection of a container marked “TEE-28” and “Biological and Radiological Hazard” immediately contact us and report your coordinates. It’s very reliably that the stolen ektanium is taken to the lab.
