You're almost there, Sergeant Major. Soon you should get to one of the entrances to the lab. If you notice any strange mass migration of the enemy or numerous bots’ departures, report immediately. The tensions are growing.

D’you know what we are told by these sons of New Order, as they call themselves? There are no limits of human stupidity, and it's really true. I guess you heard about the Apocalypse in 2112. Yes, yes, this tale of ancient Inkas. So, two very powerful, but very brainless guys lapped it all up. And they began to build “The First Ark”. So that the lab where you're going to get is creation place of interstellar, yes, it is interstellar rather than interplanetary spacecraft.  Renaissance Corporation began the first work on this project almost 15 years ago. To complete the construction of these engines the guys needed ectanium. As you know, its extraction and processing is such an important task for national security that ectanium can’t be in enemy hands. When almost all attempts, legal or not, to produce ectanium failed, our fanatics in despair had to resort to drastic measures, and kidnapping of the Prince and attack on the most important points of the Empire - that's just the beginning.

Get to the lab, Sgt.
