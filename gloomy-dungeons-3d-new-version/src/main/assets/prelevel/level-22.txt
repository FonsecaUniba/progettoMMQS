Sergeant Major Steelman (it’s you) sighed and tried to constitute a link with the Center again. However, his shabby old field radio, which went with him through fire, radioactive waste and titanplastic pipes, stubbornly refused to play any sounds that were different from static noise.

Steelman was sitting on a large boulder, sinking in the grass in the middle of an ordinary deciduous forest. From that place he could see through the far-visor the entrance to the next building of the lab and not to be noticed by viewing devices. Sectarians (as Sergeant Major started to call them to himself), didn’t hide so much. Two guards stood and chatted in front of lab entrance, breaking all the official instructions and regulations. Steelman almost choked when he saw that one of the guards ate popcorn with appetite.

Sergeant Major sighed and tried to call the center again, but to no avail. I’ll have to act on my own. He set his machine gun and shotgun straight, hoisted case with cartridges onto his back, checked that nothing was noisy and hampering, and made his way toward the door to the lab.
