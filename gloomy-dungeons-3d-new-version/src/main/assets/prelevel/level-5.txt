Excellent work! Our eggheaded friends from the lab of L. department nearly tore my arms when I brought them tissue samples of these worms. They are still locked in the laboratory and do not go out a day already. Security report that behind the door, they hear the hysterical cries “It’s impossible” and crack of ripping somebody’s hair. I commanded them not to interfere with the scientists. What if they’ll come up with something smart and useful.

Meantime, you’ll have to continue your picnic in the dark and frightening crannies of “Renaissance”, there’s nothing you can do. We need to find out who behind it all is, and whether the project “Apple worm” is someone’s private initiative within the corporation or the Corporation Council decided to move to the next level and it’s time to rule our state.
