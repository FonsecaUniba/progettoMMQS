I have bad news for you, Master Sgt. 13 minutes ago, our satellites over the laboratory detected 40 launches of small aircrafts with a concealed launch sites near the laboratory.

The results are disappointing, all bosses scattered in the laboratory like cockroaches from dichlorvos spray. We, of course, tried to catch as much “droplets” as possible, but alas, all the captured “drops” were controlled by autopilots. We didn’t manage to capture a single person. According to your reports, total outrage is starting in the lab, and the worms are just eager to get acquainted with the greatest possible mass of people. As you know, we should prevent it. So your mission is to hold out until reinforcements arrive.

But that’s the theory. In practice, the arrival time of assault groups is tens of minutes, we can’t wait so long. So, turn this place into a quiet and peaceful cemetery. I believe in you.
