Congratulations to the medal and the military rank of sergeant-major! Although we couldn’t find the prince, but the capture of Right Hand, the second lab and all the documentation – is fine also. Not everything at once, right? Let’s move on to business.

The new data allow us to say with 100% accuracy, where the lab number 3 is, it is also the main headquarters of the New Order. As usual, our mission is simple: come and make these miserable slugs cry and beg for forgiveness. But, as you know, the Imperial Security Committee won’t forgive!

... Two hours after departure:
- ... Yes, yes, I hear you, Sergeant Major! We lost position of your “unicorn” 7 minutes ago. Shot down? Report on the losses! Three badly injured? So, we located place of your fall. Rescue bots had already departed. Meantime I offer to look around and assess the situation. According to the data and your coordinates, you are just a few kilometers from the main lab of the New Order.
